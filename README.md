# WebGUI

This repository was developed for the fall 2023 M2I expo. It relies on Node.js, Angular, Nginx, and Docker. If you do not have experience in these areas and wish to use this code, I recommend watching videos to get a solid understanding.

## How To Use
There are many different ways to host the web server:
1. Run the `docker-compose`
2. Run a container from the `web/Dockerfile`
3. Run `ng serve` inside `web/`

Then open the webpage. If it ever disconnects from the robot, just refresh the page.
